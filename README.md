# Kotero

An Android client for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).

This is a work in progress. The app is not yet usable.

## Building

To build the project, you need to create a `local.properties` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the following lines:

```
ZOTERO_API_KEY=<your zotero api key>
ZOTERO_USER_ID=<your zotero user id>
```
